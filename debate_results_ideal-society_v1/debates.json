The lack of clear decision-making structures could lead to indecision and gridlock. In a decentralized democracy, strong leaders can emerge, overshadowing community input. Over-reliance on technology might also come at the cost of human connection. Scaling regional councils can be challenging, particularly when considering global needs.\n\nMy ideal society may not be perfect, but it has the potential for growth and refinement. By acknowledging its flaws and addressing them, we can create a more resilient and harmonious society that balances individual freedom with collective well-being."
